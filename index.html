            <h1>Akan Names</h1>
        <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from countries such as Togo,<br>
            Ivory Coast and Ghana. A child’s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. <br>
            For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born may determine which name they <br>
            get irrespective of their gender. These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition,<br>
            each child is born with a name associated to their soul. The day the child is born is therefore determined by the soul. <br>
